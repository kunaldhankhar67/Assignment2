# Assignment2
For problem 1 - I wrote a code in which the user has to enter a number and after that ther if else condition runs on the condition of (%==0) to check whether the number is even or odd and print the desired output.
For problem 2 - I defined an interger ( sum)with a value 0. Then i ran a loop for a (number)in the range of 1 to 50 and under that i added the (number) to the integer which initially had zero value and outside the loop i printed the integer (sum) for the sum with the desired line.
